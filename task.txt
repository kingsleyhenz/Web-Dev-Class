classwork

1) create a html documents with five h1 elements 
2) create an external stylesheet file and link it to your html file
3) three of the h1 elements should have a class name and 2 should have an Id
4) each of them should be assigned a diffrent color for you stylesheet file
   by calling the Id or class name


   GOODLUCK!!!
